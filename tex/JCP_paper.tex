%% Text of abstract
We introduce a novel boundary condition for incompressible Eulerian simulations formulated using a Biot-Savart vorticity integral that maintains high-accuracy results even when the domain boundary is within a body-length of immersed solid boundaries. The key prerequisite to accurately couple the Biot-Savart condition to the Eulerian velocity and pressure fields is including the influence of the vorticity generated at the immersed boundaries during the incompressible-flow projection step. While the resulting linear operator for the pressure is non-local, it can be efficiently solved by partitioning into the standard local Poisson operator and the Biot-Savart update and solving iteratively. Simple oct-tree clustering for the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) evaluation of the Biot-Savart integral reduces the cost of updating the boundaries of a 3D simulation with $N$ points from $O(N^{5/3})$ to $O(N)$ and has bounded error. We show that the new method captures the analytical added-mass force of accelerating 2D and 3D plates exactly and matches experimentally measured wake development even when the entire domain only extends 1/2 diameter from the plate. The new method also predicts accurate time-varying forces for a 2D circle and 3D sphere regardless of domain size, while classical boundary conditions require a domain 48 times larger in 2D to converge on the new method's result. Finally, we study the highly sensitive 2D deflected wakes produced by high frequency flapping foils to the new boundary conditions and show that truncating the deflected wake within four cord-lengths of the body changes the body force amplitudes by 10-40\%. Doubling the 
wake size recovers the asymptotic results to within 5\%.

\section{Introduction}
% introduce the problem
Computational fluid dynamics provides a numerical solution to a continuum problem in an often unbounded domain. Common practice is to approximate the continuum problem with a discrete set of equations and truncate the unbounded domain to a finite computational domain with \emph{far-field} boundary conditions. 

External incompressible flows enforce far-field boundary conditions on the computational domain's exterior. These consist of a known velocity normal to the boundary and a known normal pressure gradient\footnote{for a description of the boundary conditions for the incompressible \emph{Navier-Stokes} equations, we refer the reader to \cite{Gresho1987}}. These can lead to significant errors. In particular, the force acting on a body can suffer from severe \emph{blockage effects} when the computational domain is not \emph{sufficiently large}. Here, sufficiently large means that the decaying potential flow induced by the body and the advection/diffusion of vorticity through the domain's boundary have no influence on the solution \cite{Colonius2008}. While domain sensitivity study can determine the extent of the blockage, there is no \emph{a priori} rule for estimating their magnitude, making this an expansive iterative process. It is also computationally inefficient to add grid cells to fill such a large domain, and grid refinement near the solid boundaries introduces well-known sensitives to the grid expansion ratios and cell aspect ratios due to numerical diffusion, dispersion, reflection, and linear system stiffness. Alternatively, numerical dissipation can be explicitly imposed in a buffer layer on a smaller domain that forces the solution to decay rapidly before it reaches the boundaries \cite{Colonius2002ADomains}.

Domain augmentation is a more principled approach to simulate external flow, such as using a large coarse grid to provide artificial far-field boundary conditions for a small well-resolved domain \cite{Colonius2008}. The outer flow field can also be augmented with a vortex particle-mesh method, reducing dispersive errors \cite{Billuart2023AFlows}. Such methods enable tracking the wake for an extended time while enabling accurate modeling of the developing boundary layer on the object's surface and can also include immersed boundaries \cite{Marichal2015UnboundedMethods}. However, these methods rely on several (user-defined) parameters to correctly interpolate between the two domains, requiring an iterative approach to find the best parameters.

For flows with one \cite{Grosch1977NumericalTransforms} or two unbounded directions \cite{Rennich1997NumericalDirections, Levy2022SolvingMethod}, coordinate transforms and/or analytical potential flow solution \cite{Tsynkov1998NumericalReview} can be applied in the unbounded directions. Potential flow boundary conditions are prescribed following the classical \emph{Helmholtz} decomposition of the velocity field into an irrotational and an incompressible part
\begin{equation}\label{eq:u_vort}
    \vec{u} = \vec{u}_\omega + \nabla\phi + \vec{U}_\infty = -\nabla^{-2}\left(\nabla \times \vec{\omega}\right) + \nabla\phi + \vec{U}_\infty
\end{equation}
where $\vec{u}_\omega$, $\nabla\phi$, $\vec{U}_\infty$ are the incompressible, irrotational, and the free-stream components, respectively. While these methods are elegant, they rely either on a single unbounded direction as in \cite{Grosch1977NumericalTransforms} or formulating the problem in a coordinate system where two unbounded directions are transformed to a single one (for example, from Cartesian to Cylindrical in \cite{Levy2022SolvingMethod}), which do not occur regularly in practical flow applications.

Other classes of methods solve unbounded Poisson equations by incorporating the unbounded conditions as Dirichlet boundary data, either by successive relaxed iterations of the Poisson problem with the Dirichlet data computed using the previous solution \cite{Miller2008AnBoundaries} or by using the James-Lackner \cite{Jamb1977TheDistributions, Lackner1976COMPUTATIONEQUILIBRIA} algorithm that solves two nested domain Poisson problems, the inner domain with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and outer domain with inhomogeneous Neumann boundary conditions computed from a boundary convolution of the inner solution with the fundamental solution to the Poisson operator. To accelerate the convolution, multilevel approximation \cite{Mccorquodale2006ADimensions} or local correction methods \cite{Kavouklis2019ComputationCorrections} can be used. Although these methods enforce unbounded boundary conditions, they require iterating a Poisson problem or solving it multiple times. 

Finally, fundamental solutions to discrete operators (Lattice Green's functions or LGFs) and their asymptotic expansions can be used to solve the discrete Poisson equations in unbounded domains \cite{Liska2014AEquations, Beckers2022PlanarGrids}. Points close to the source are evaluated with the discrete kernel (accurate), while points far away are evaluated with the asymptotic expansion (fast). These methods rely on the unbounded properties of the LGFs and can simulate unbounded viscous incompressible flow \cite{Liska2016ADomains} and flows with immersed-boundaries \cite{Liska2017AFunctions}. This allows for snug computational domains limited to regions of non-negligible vorticity or possibly a set of disjoint domains limited to active vorticity regions. Combined with a multi-resolution approach, the LGF approach can yield fast and accurate computation of 3D incompressible flows at a cost reduced compared to Cartesian meshes \cite{Dorschner2020AEquations}. However, the method relies on a structured grid and a constant coefficient Poisson equation, and the possibility of extending the method to unstructured mesh and variable coefficient Poisson equation problems (such as the one arising in \cite{Lauber2022}) is unclear.

In this manuscript, we propose a novel method for imposing external potential-flow boundary conditions of a viscous flow simulation by coupling to a vorticity-based description of the flow on the boundary via the Biot-Savart equation. The method retains the primitive variables formulation ($\vec u$ and $p$) of the governing equations, is compatible with immersed boundary methods, variable coefficient Poisson equations, fast pressure projection methods, and does not require additional meshes to describe the flow. In the next section, we describe the Biot-Savart boundary conditions and how they are injected into a projection algorithm to solve the \emph{Navier-Stokes} equations. Next, we described a simplified multi-level clustering approach for an optimal $O(N)$ Fast Multipole-pole Method (FMM) for the Biot-Savart integral, and demonstrate the balance between speedup and accuracy in the reconstructed velocity field. With confined vorticity and vortex wake examples, we demonstrate that the new boundary conditions significantly outperform standard reflective boundary conditions on significantly smaller domains. We present an unexpected result: the new method continues to perform well when the fundamental assumption of potential flow external to the domain is violated, and we use the unstable deflected wakes generated by fast flapping foils to study the limits of the approach. We finish this manuscript by discussing the method's applicability to various flows in science and engineering.

\section{Method}

    \caption{Schematic of the fluid domain $\Omega$ with an immersed body $\mathcal{B}$ and their common (wet) interface $\partial\mathcal{B}$. The exterior of the computational domain $\Omega$ is denoted as $\partial\Omega$ with $\hat{n}$ the unit normal vector.}
    \label{Fig_1}
\end{figure}

We start by describing the governing equations and their numerical solution.
The flow is governed by the \emph{Navier-Stokes} equations for an incompressible flow. We discretize these equations on a staggered finite-volume mesh. The resulting system of equations is solved within a computational domain $\Omega(N)$, where $N$ is the number of degrees of freedom of the problem. The outer domain boundary is denoted at $\partial\Omega(N^{\cal S})$, where $\cal S$ is a factor linked to the dimensions $n$ of the problem. When $n=2$ we have ${\cal S}=1/2$, and when $n=3$ ${\cal S}=2/3$. The primary source of vorticity in the domain is an immersed body $\mathcal{B}$ with outer (wet) surface $\partial\mathcal{B}$ and unit normal vector $\hat n$, see Figure~\ref{Fig_1}.

We use the standard projection scheme \cite{Chorin1967} to solve the coupled velocity-pressure system inside a predictor-correct method to achieve second-order temporal convergence of the flow variables \cite{Lauber2022}. 
To simplify the discussion, we present the method for the first step of the predictor-corrector; generalization to the second-order Heun's corrector or higher-order time integration method is straightforward. The projection method starts with an explicit estimate of the intermediate velocity field $u^*$
\begin{align}\label{eq:intermediate}
    \vec{u}^* = \vec{u}\,^t + \int_{t}^{t+\Delta t}\frac{1}{\text{Re}}\nabla^2\vec{u} -\left(\vec{u}\cdot\nabla\right)\vec{u}\text{ d}t &\quad\forall\ \vec{x}\in\Omega (N),
\end{align}
where $\text{Re}$ is the Reynolds number of the flow. Depending on the choice of integration method for the right-hand-side, we obtain explicit or semi-implicit methods. Here we will focus on fully explicit methods. On the immersed body $
\cal B$, the intermediate velocity is subject to the condition
\begin{equation}
    \vec{u}^* = \vec{U}_b \quad \forall x \in \partial\cal{B}.
\end{equation} 
where $\vec{U}_b$ is the body velocity. Body-fitted methods enforce this condition directly, while immersed boundary methods enforce it indirectly; either by reformulating the governing equations near the boundary such as \cite{Peskin2010,Maertens2015} or by modifying the discretization near $\cal{B}$ \cite{Lee2015}.

Additionally, Eq.~\eqref{eq:intermediate} must be supplemented with far-field boundary conditions on the domain's outer boundaries. The simplest of these is a (local) reflection condition
\begin{align}\label{eq:BC_1}
    \frac{\partial \vec{u}^*_s}{\partial \hat{n}} = 0,\ \vec{u}^*_n = U_n &\quad\forall\ \vec{x}\in\partial\Omega (N^{\cal S}),
\end{align}
where $\vec U$ is the free-stream velocity and we have decomposed the velocity field on the boundary in a boundary normal $\vec{u}^*_n$ and tangential part $\vec{u}^*_s$. We refer the reader to \cite{Gresho1987} for a discussion of pressure boundary conditions on the domain's exterior.

Projection of the divergent velocity field onto the solenoidal space is achieved by computing a pressure field $p$ that removes the divergent part of the intermediate velocity field
\begin{align}\label{eq:poisson}
      &\nabla\cdot\frac{\Delta t}{\rho}\nabla p = \nabla\cdot \vec{u}^* &\quad\forall\ \vec{x}\in\Omega (N),\\
      \label{eq:project}
      &\vec{u}^{t+\Delta t} = \vec{u}^*-\frac{\Delta t}{\rho}\nabla p &\quad\forall\ \vec{x}\in\Omega (N),
\end{align}
also subject to the standard boundary condition
\begin{align}\label{eq:BC_2}
      &\frac{\partial \vec{u}^{t+\Delta t}_s}{\partial \hat{n}} = 0,\ \vec{u}^{t+\Delta t}_n = U_n &\quad\forall\ \vec{x}\in\partial\Omega (N^{\cal S}).
\end{align}

As mentioned previously, the boundary $\partial\Omega$ must be placed sufficiently far away from the body not to influence the decaying potential flow part of the velocity field and ensure enough space to properly advect the vorticity downstream. 

\subsection{Biot-Savart boundary conditions}

We propose to replace the typical ``local" domain boundary conditions such as Eq.~\eqref{eq:BC_1} \& ~\eqref{eq:BC_2} by a Biot-Savart integral over the vorticity inside the domain. A Green's function solution to the vorticity equation Eq.~\eqref{eq:u_vort} gives the velocity at a point $\vec x$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Biot}
    {\vec u}({\vec x}) = f(\vec x; \vec\omega,\Omega) = \int_\Omega K_{n}({\vec x} - \vec{y})\times \vec\omega({\vec y})\text{ d}\vec{y} \quad\quad \forall \vec x\, \in \partial\Omega (N^{\cal S})
\end{equation}
where $K_n$ is the $n$-dimensional Biot-Savart kernel. This kernel takes the following form \cite{Eldredge2019MathematicalFlows}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:kernels}
    2D:\quad K(\vec r)\equiv -\frac{\vec{r}}{2\pi|\vec{r}|^2}, \qquad\qquad 3D:\quad K(\vec r)\equiv -\frac{\vec{r}}{4\pi|\vec{r}|^3}.
\end{equation}
The vortex-induced velocity of Biot-Savart integral is simply added to the uniform background velocity $\vec U$ to determine the total velocity at any point. We will omit further discussion of the trivial uniform flow contribution in this section.

This formulation implicitly assumes the flow external to the domain is irrotational and that the flow is incompressible everywhere. This assumption is met when all the vorticity is confined within the computational domain such as for the flow around accelerated bodies when the time $\frac{tU}{L}\lesssim t^{\text{crit.}}$, with $t^{\text{crit.}}$ the critical time for vortex detachment \cite{Shusser2000EnergyRing}. However, we will show that the results of using equation \eqref{eq:Biot} in an Eulerian solver are still highly accurate for flows with wakes that extend to the domain boundary. 

Note that on a staggered grid, we only need to apply the integral equation \eqref{eq:Biot} to compute the velocity normal to the domain face. For ghost cells external to the computational domain, we use the local derivative conditions $\nabla\cdot\vec{u} = \nabla\times\vec{u}=0$ to compute the velocity. These conditions are consistent with the assumption that the flow is potential outside the domain and fast to apply. Specifically, we apply the zero curl condition to all tangential velocity components in the ghost cells and then the zero divergence condition to the normal components in the ghost cells, marching away from the domain boundary.

\subsection{Biot-Savart Projection Algorithm}\label{sec:Biot_projection}

The main contribution of this manuscript is injecting the Biot-Savart integral into the classical projection scheme and solving the resulting coupled problem. The momentum update using the new Biot-Savart domain condition proceeds as before: forming the intermediate velocity with Eq.~\ref{eq:intermediate} and projecting it to be divergence free with Eq.~\ref{eq:project}. However, the new boundary condition introduces a coupling between the body and domain boundaries. To see this, we substitute the update equation for the velocity at the new time-step (Eq.~\ref{eq:project}) into the Biot-Savart equation for the boundary velocity (Eq.~\ref{eq:Biot}) to give to complete equation for the boundary velocity at $t+\Delta t$
\begin{align}\label{eq:biot-press}
    &\vec{u}^{t+\Delta t}(\vec x_b) = f(\vec{x_b},\nabla\times \vec{u}^{t+\Delta t},\Omega) = f(\vec{x_b},\nabla\times\vec{u}^*,\Omega)-f\left(\vec{x_b},\nabla\times\frac{\Delta t}{\rho}\nabla p,\Omega\right) 
\end{align}
While the gradient of a field cannot induce curl in an \textit{unbounded} fluid region ($\nabla\times\nabla\phi\equiv 0$), the pressure generates a thin layer of vorticity \textit{on the body boundary} $\partial\cal B$ every time-step \cite{Morton1984GeophysicalTy}. This means that the last term in Eq.~\ref{eq:biot-press} is non-zero, coupling every point on the body boundary to every point on the domain boundary.

Because of the pressure contribution in Eq.~\ref{eq:biot-press}, the pressure projection (Eq.~\ref{eq:poisson}) becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:complex_poisson}
    \nabla\cdot\left[\frac{\Delta t}{\rho}\nabla p + f\left(\vec{x_b},\nabla\times\frac{\Delta t}{\rho}\nabla p,\Omega\right)\right] = \nabla\cdot\left[ \vec{u}^* + f(\vec{x_b},\nabla\times\vec{u}^*,\Omega)\right], \quad\forall\
    \begin{array}{l}
    \vec{x} \in \Omega(N),\\
    \vec{x}_b \in \partial\Omega(N^\mathcal{S})
    \end{array}
\end{equation}
Unlike the linear operator resulting from discretizing Eq.~\ref{eq:poisson} with a local finite-difference finite-volume or finite-element method which has only $O(N)$ non-zero terms, the coupling induced by the Biot-Savart equation results in a dense matrix with at least $O(N^{1+S})$ non-zero terms. Note that this coupling is only apparent in immersed boundary methods if the pressure boundary conditions are correctly imposed on the immersed body during the projection step, but failing to do so can lead to large errors in the pressure force predictions; see, for example \cite{Taira2007, Lauber2022}.

We must accurately include the coupling term in Eq.~\ref{eq:biot-press}, but we want to avoid constructing the dense matrix or requiring substantial changes to existing Poisson solvers to make it practical for Eulerian schemes to use Biot-Savart boundary conditions. This is possible by using a partitioned approach
\begin{equation}\label{eq:differed_poisson}
    \nabla\cdot\frac{\Delta t}{\rho}\nabla p^{k+1} = \nabla\cdot\left[ \vec{u}^* + f\left(\vec{x_b},\nabla\times\left[\vec{u}^*-\frac{\Delta t}{\rho}\nabla p^k\right],\Omega\right)\right], \quad\forall\
    \begin{array}{l}
    \vec{x} \in \Omega(N),\\
    \vec{x}_b \in \partial\Omega(N^\mathcal{S})
    \end{array}
\end{equation}
iteratively updating the right-hand-side residual with Eq.~\ref{eq:Biot} using the previous pressure solution $p^k$ and updating the pressure solution $p^{k+1}$ with a Poisson solver iteration until the coupled system converges. This approach differs from the one in \cite{Miller2008AnBoundaries} for unbounded Poisson problems with embedded Dirichlet boundaries as we directly adjust the residual of the (iterative) Poisson solver and we do not iterate over the coupled Poisson/interior boundary problem. This also make it unique from the James-Lackner algorithm which solves constructs and solves a dense Poisson system \cite{Mccorquodale2006ADimensions}. 

In this work, we use a Multi-Grid solver for the Poisson system, as described in \cite{Weymouth2022Data-drivenProjection}, and updating the domain velocities and corresponding Poisson residuals at the end of each V-cycle is sufficient to ensure the final pressure and velocity field converge to satisfy both the momentum and divergence-free conditions without increasing the number of V-cycle iterations. In fact, the ability of the flow to pass through the domain boundaries \textit{reduces} the stiffness of the Poisson system for domains tight to the body boundary, improving the iterative convergence rate.

\subsection{Fast evaluation of the Biot-Savart integral}

The aim of Biot-Savart boundary conditions is to reduce the computational cost compared to a large grid by providing an accurate estimate of the far-field conditions. The boundary conditions are agnostic of the method used to compute the integral in Eq.~\ref{eq:Biot}, but a naive evaluation would require $O(N)$ operations \textit{for each boundary point}, meaning $O(N^{1+\cal S})$ cost overall, potentially overwhelming any savings from reducing the size of the domain.

Numerous methods have been developed to reduce the cost of this convolution. In vortex particle-mesh methods, the integral is usually evaluated with \emph{Fast Multipole Method} (FMM) \cite{Greencard1987ASimulations}, or a variant \cite{Ying2004ADimensions, Fong2009TheMethod}, that allows reducing this cost to $O(\log N)$ or even $O(1)$ operations per vortex point. Such methods  rely on the fast decay of the convolution kernel (Eq.~\ref{eq:kernels}) to evaluate only a reduced set of ``source'' points $\vec y$ for every ``target'' $\vec x$. We refer the reader to the papers above for a thorough description and error analysis of FMM.

The use of the Biot-Savart equation to set (only) the domain boundary conditions of an Eulerian flow solver allows for significant simplifications to a standard FMM. The $N$ cells in the domain are vorticity sources but we have only $O(N^{\cal S})$ targets, exclusively on the exterior. Additionally, as the reconstruction is not used to directly solve the Poisson equation, but simply correct the source, truncating the multipole has no effect on the final solution accuracy (set by the Poisson solver tolerance).

Here, we use a multi-level clustering method for the sources which leverages their uniform distribution in our Eulerian setting. We construct the multi-level field by representing the complete domain $\Omega$ with a combination of progressively coarser subdomains
\begin{equation}\label{eq:multilevel}
    \Omega = \mathcal{D}^{(1)}(\vec x) \cup \mathcal{D}^{(2)}(\vec x) \cup \cdots \cup \mathcal{D}^{(l-1)}(\vec x) \cup \mathcal{D}^{(l)}(\vec x),
\end{equation}
where level $1$ is the finest subdomain and $l$ is the coarsest, and each subdomain is non-overlapping and their union fully covers $\Omega$. The cell size doubles with each level $h^{(i+1)}=2h^{(i)}$ and we define the sub-domains as nested rectangular boxes of half-width $S^{(i)}=h^{(i)}\tilde S$ centered on the target location $\vec x$, Fig \ref{Fig_2}. 

We fill the vorticity field $\omega^{(i)}$ on each domain level $\Omega^{(i)}$ recursively by uniformly pooling the circulation $\Gamma=\omega h^2$ on the level above 
\begin{equation}
\Gamma^{(i+1)}=\mathcal{P}^{(i)\to(i+1)}\Gamma^{(i)}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma^{(1)}$ is the original finest level field and the pooling $\mathcal{P}$ for a cell at level $i+1$ simply sums over the corresponding sub-cells in level $i$, see Fig.\ref{Fig_2}. Thus, our multi-level field conserves the total circulation to machine precision, as recommended by \cite{Colonius2008} and others. Filling the entire multi-level source field requires $O(N)$ operations.

In this work, we present results from two alternative boundary velocity reconstruction approaches using the multi-level source clustering described above:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the first approach, the integral over the original domain $\Omega$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:Biot} is simply replaced with a sum over all the contribution from each subdomain
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:biot_sum}
        \vec u(\vec{x}) \approx \sum_{i=1}^{l} f(\vec{x}; \vec \omega^{(i)},\mathcal{D}^{(i)}(\vec x)).
    \end{equation}
    This corresponds to a direct sum for each target $\vec x$ over an oct-tree source field in 3D (or a quad-tree field in 2D). Therefore, we call this the ``tree-sum'' approach. As each subdomain has $O(\tilde S^n)$ sources and the number of levels $l=O(\log N)$, the tree-sum requires $O(\tilde S^n\log N)$ operations per target.
    \item In the second approach, we \textit{also} cluster the target points $\vec  x^{\,(i)}$ on the boundaries of each $\Omega^{(i)}$ domain. We then define the level-$i$ kernel interaction velocities as
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:interaction}
        \vec v^{\,(i)}(\vec x^{\,(i)}) = f(\vec x^{\,(i)}; \vec \omega^{(i)},\mathcal{D}^{(i)}(\vec x^{\,(i)})).
    \end{equation}
    The target velocities are then unpooled recursively from the coarsest level to the finest
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:unpool}
        \vec u^{\,(i)} \approx \vec v^{\,(i)}+\mathcal{P}^{(i+1)\to(i)} \vec u^{\,(i+1)}
    \end{equation}
    where $u^{\,(l+1)}=0$ and the unpooling operator is bi-linear interpolation to the target locations $\vec x^{\,(i)}$. As the interaction velocities are independent at each level, they require a constant $O(\tilde S^n)$ operations per target. Therefore, we call this the Fast Multi-\textit{level} Method (FM$\ell$M). 
\end{enumerate}

A key difference between these approaches and a classic FMM is that the contributions from each clustered source point are obtained by evaluating Eq.~\ref{eq:kernels} directly and not through a classical or kernel-independent multipole expansion, as done in \cite{Ying2004ADimensions, Liska2014AEquations}. The reconstruction error is bounded and and decreases as $\tilde S^{-n}$, as shown in \ref{A0}. %The unpooling step introduces an additional error into the FM$\ell$M approach.

% In the classical FMM method, the small error induced by the mismatch of the location of the clustered targets on the coarser level $(l+1)$ and the point of evaluation $\vec x$ can be corrected using the translation properties of the kernel \cite{}. The same approach can be used here, but because the projection step is solved with an interactive solver, only an approximate induced velocity field is sufficient, and this correction is omitted.

Finally, we note that since each Biot-Savart kernel evaluation is independent, we can parallelize the velocity reconstruction to further accelerate the method. Our implementation applies GPU or CPU multi-threading to parallelize (i) the calculation and pooling of the vorticity across the sources, and (ii) the kernel function evaluation and velocity unpooling across the targets.

\section{Confined vorticity applications}

We first validate the application of the Biot-Savart boundary conditions using a set of impulsive flow problems. The flow is truly irrotational outside the computational domain, matching the implicit assumptions required to use the Biot-Savart equations to reconstruct the velocity on the boundary. 

Our Biot-Savart boundary conditions are implemented inside \textbf{\color{cyan}{{WaterLily.jl}}}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/WaterLily-jl/WaterLily.jl}}, a fast, immersed-boundary flow solver based on the Boundary data immersion method \cite{Maertens2015} that can execute both on CPU and GPU \cite{Weymouth2023WaterLily.jl:Execution}. To leverage the GPU capability of the flow solver and fully benefit from our novel boundary conditions, we perform all computations presented herein on an NVIDIA-A6000 GPU (48GB memory). The complete code and instructions needed to reproduce these results are freely available at \url{https://github.com/weymouth/BiotSavartBCs.jl}.

\subsection{2D and 3D flow around an accelerating disk}

The flow around a 2D or 3D disk accelerated from rest in a quiescent flow is purely potential for $t\to 0^+$. As a result, an analytical expression for the added mass coefficient can be used to validate our novel potential flow boundary condition when injected in a moment step of the \emph{Navier-Stokes} equations. 

The disk of radius $R$ and diameter $D=2R$ is given a constant acceleration $a$ for the initial non-dimensional time $t^*=at/U\le 1$ and is given a constant speed after this, ie
\begin{equation}
    U(t) = \begin{cases}
        at, \quad \text{if } at/U\le1,\\
        U, \quad \text{else}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
We perform 2D and 3D simulations of the flow around a plate/circular disk immersed in a domain of dimension $1.5D\times1.5D\,\,(\times1.5D)$ with a resolution of 86 cells per diameter ($D$). From potential flow theory, the added-mass coefficient for an impulsively started flow is
\begin{equation}
    Ca  = \frac{F_{am}}{\rho D^3 a} = \frac{F_{am}}{\rho D^2U^2}\left(\frac{1}{a^*}\right) % = \frac{1}{3}
\end{equation}
where $Ca$ is the classical added-mass coefficient. We simulate the 2D or 3D flow until $t^*=3$. Once the disk reaches its peak velocity, the Reynolds number is $\text{Re}=\frac{UR}{\nu}=1000$.

We note here that the 2D and 3D problems possess axes of symmetry that would allow only a portion of the domain to be modeled. This can be easily accounted for in the Biot-Savart boundary conditions by adding the contributions of the images of each vortex cell, see \ref{A1}. However, to avoid unnecessary complications in this manuscript, we model the full plate and do not use the problem's symmetries.

Figure~\ref{fig:disk_flow_1} shows the vorticity and pressure field for three consecutive times during the disk's motion on the midplane of the 3D circular disk. The top row shows the results with the standard reflective boundary conditions (the entire computational domain is shown), and the bottom row shows the flow obtained with the Biot-Savart boundary conditions. High blockage effects are apparent for the reflective boundary conditions, which generate a stronger shear layer that feeds a stronger vortex located further downstream than the Biot-Savart results. The error in the pressure field due to the homogeneous Neumann condition placed close to the immersed body generates pressure peaks twice as large as with the Biot-Savart boundary conditions.

Fig.~\ref{fig:disk_forces} shows the time trace of the pressure force acting on the accelerated disk, as well as the equivalent 2D simulation on an accelerating flat plate for comparison. The difference in the pressure field is found again in the difference in the forces. Here, the Biot-Savart boundary condition can exactly recover the added-mass force on the first time step, while the reflective boundary condition overestimates it. For larger $t^*$, the effect of the boundary condition is still observable; the reflective boundary condition significantly overestimates the pressure forces for all $t$.

Next we demonstrate the low sensitivity of the Eulerian flow solver using the simple partitioned approach of Eq.~\ref{eq:differed_poisson} to the implementation details of the Biot-Savart kernel summation. Fig.~\ref{fig:disk_forces}(b) compares the instantaneous drag force acting on the 3D disk using the tree-sum and FM$\ell$M approach over a range of clustering subdomain sizes. The results are extremely consistent, with any $\tilde S \ge 2$ predicting identical forces and only the smallest possible half-width $\tilde S=1$ leading to a few percent increase in the predicted peak force at $t^*=2$. In addition, the forces are identical using the two approaches despite the additional unpooling step of the FM$\ell$M.

This minimal sensitivity means that we can maintain accuracy while maximizing the reconstruction speed. For the remainder of the manuscript we will use the FM$\ell$M approach with $\tilde S = 2$ for 3D flows, and $\tilde S = 4$ for 2D. We therefore use $O(N)$ operations for clustering the sources and $O(N^{\cal S})$ operations for reconstructing the target velocities for each V-cycle of the pressure solver, which itself is $O(N)$. In practice, we find that using Biot-Savart boundary conditions on small domains in 2D can double the simulation speed compared to using reflection condition on the same domain because of the artificially fast flow speeds shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:disk_flow_1} decreasing the possible time-step. In 3D we find simulation times are basically identical using Biot-Savart boundary conditions or reflection conditions on the same domain, with the small reconstruction and increased time-step effects canceling.

\subsection{3D Flow around a square disk at $\text{Re}=125\,000$}

We next simulate the flow around a square plate of dimension $L\times L$, accelerated in the surface normal direction to a final Reynolds number $\text{Re}=125\,000$ to demonstrate the ability of our method to deal with highly separated and turbulent vortex formation. We focus on the initial vortex formation and position the plate at the center of a domain of size $2L\times2L\times2L$. The disk has a resolution of 384 cells per diameter ($D$), resulting in a $y^+\sim 32$. We simulate the flow evolution until $t^*<6$, where vortices typically stay attached to the body and only separate and travel downstream later. Simulations are performed on a single \texttt{NVIDIA-A100} PCIe card with 80GB (filled at $\sim80\%$ capacity) in a little less than 160 minutes for $1.8\times10^9$ DOF, resulting in execution time of 5.1~ns/DoF/dt.


We qualitatively compare the shape of the vortex ring forming behind our accelerating square plate with the flow visualization of the same cases in \cite{Higuchi1996Three-dimensionalPlates}, who used dye coloring to visualize the wake forming behind the accelerating plate. Results are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:square_disk_comparison_oblique}, \ref{fig:square_disk_comparison} for four instants during and after the acceleration phase.

    \label{fig:square_disk_comparison_oblique}
\end{figure}
An excellent agreement between the simulations and the experiments is found for this qualitative verification, both in the oblique and downstream view from the plate. The initial vortex roll-up starts to break down due to the high-strength vortices generated by the plate's edges. The initial roll-up is extremely similar between both visualization techniques, and the shape of the vortex ring is extremely well captured by the simulations despite the minimal domain size.

\section{Developed vortex-wake applications}

Next, we study the accuracy of the new Biot-Savart conditions on flow cases with vortex wakes that are truncated by the domain boundary, introducing an additional modeling error. We use three canonical developed vortex-wake examples: (1) the flow around a 2D cylinder at a Reynolds number $\text{Re}=200$, which results in the classical \emph{van K\`arm\`an} wake, (2) the flow around a sphere at $\text{Re}=3700$, and (3) the reversed \emph{van K\`arm\`an} (or propulsive) wake generated by a heaving 2D airfoil over a range of Strouhal numbers.

\subsection{Flow around a 2D cylinder at $\text{Re}=200$}

We start our analysis with the flow behind a 2D circular cylinder of diameter $D$. The cylinder is immersed in a viscous fluid with free-stream velocity $U=(1,0)$. The viscosity is set such that the Reynolds number is $\text{Re}=\frac{UD}{\nu}=200$. We perform a domain study by varying the domain sizes from $5D\times3D$ up to $30D\times24D$ and, for each domain, compare the reflective and Biot-Savart boundary conditions.

Figure~\ref{fig:cylinder_force} shows the total drag force acting on the cylinder for the various domain sizes and boundary conditions. The Biot-Savart boundary conditions yield the best results with an excellent collapse of the drag forces regardless of the domain size, including the tiny $5D\times3D$ domain which captures no more than two wake vortices at any time. Reflective boundary conditions induce extremely large blockage effects for small domains and only slowly converge to the Biot-Savart boundary solution with a domain 48x smaller. Additionally, we compare the results obtained with a grid aligned with the mean flow direction to results obtained on a $7D\times 7D$ domain where the flow direction is $\vec{U}=[\sfrac 1{\sqrt{2}},\sfrac 1{\sqrt{2}}]$ with the Biot-Savart boundary conditions. Results are also presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:cylinder_force} and are almost indistinguishable from the results using the aligned domain.

% We note here that the computational time for the smaller domain that uses the Biot-Savart boundary conditions is equivalent to that of \textbf{add computational time}. However, the convergence of the results with domain size is far superior.

In addition to the total drag forces acting on the cylinder, we look at the vortex shedding frequency in the wake. Here again, the Biot-Savart boundary conditions show an excellent collapse of the shedding frequency, which matches that of classical bluff body vortex shedding frequency of $\text{St}\sim 0.3$. The high blockage effect induced by the reflective boundary conditions induces fast flow around the cylinder, adding a non-physical domain-size dependence on the shedding frequency.

(right) The frequency spectrum of the wake of the cylinder for the same combination of boundary conditions and domain size shows the classical shedding frequency at $\text{St}=0.3$.}

\subsection{3D flow around a sphere}

\begin{figure}

    \label{fig:sphere}
\end{figure}

The flow around a sphere is used to validate the coupled momentum-Biot-Savart update for developed 3D flows. A sphere of diameter $D$ is immersed in a viscous incompressible flow. The Reynolds number is set to $Re=UD/\nu=3700$, and we vary the domain size from $C\times[5L/2,L,L]$ with $C\in[1,1.5,2]$. The diameter of the cylinder is set $D=L/3$. We use a resolution of 88 cells per diameter to perform the simulation. The flow is impulsively started from rest to a uniform velocity $U=[1,0,0]$. 

We perform the simulations for 200 convective time $tU/L$ and Figure~\ref{fig:sphere}(a) shows the drag coefficient when using the Biot-Savart boundary condition is insensitive to the domain size - even for domains only 50\% wider than the sphere diameter and 2 diameters long. Figure~\ref{fig:sphere}(b) shows the averaged drag over the last 100 convective time for all blockage ratios compares favorably to the DNS and LES simulation results obtained in \cite{Yun2006VorticalNumbers, Rodriguez2011Direct3700}. 

\subsection{Wake behind a heaving foil}

The previous results suggest that the wake history on the immersed body is very small for drag wakes. We next continue our analysis with thrust wakes, where the influence of wake history is expected to be stronger.

We immerse a rigid foil of length $L$ moving with a linear velocity $\vec{U}=(U,0)$ in a viscous fluid. In addition to its steady forward speed, the foil undergoes a pure heave motion of amplitude $h_0$
\begin{equation}
    y(t) = h_0 \sin(2\pi f t)
\end{equation}
where $h_0/L=0.5$ is the non-dimensional amplitude, and the frequency is $f = \text{St}\,U/h_0$. For Strouhal number $\text{St}<0.5$, the airfoil generates thrust, and almost no net lift, and for $\text{St}>0.6$, the wake generated by this flapping foil is strongly asymmetric and generates a significant net lift force. We perform simulations of this system for a range of Strouhal numbers and compare the mean lift force and wake obtained on a large domain ($30L\times20L$) with standard reflective boundary conditions to the ones obtained on two different domains of size ($6L\times4L$) and ($12L\times8L$) that use the Biot-Savart boundary conditions. We simulate the flow around this heaving airfoil for 100 convective times to ensure that the wake stabilizes, and we gather pressure and viscous forces for the last 20 convective times. Mean lift forces are obtained by time-averaging these forces over the past 20 convective times.

    \label{fig:deflected_wake_2}
\end{figure}

We observe almost no difference between the boundary conditions and domain sizes for $\text{St}<0.5$. The wake is symmetric, and the airfoil produces zero mean lift forces; Fig.~\ref{fig:deflected_wake_2}(a). For $\text{St}\ge 0.5$, we observe wake deflection due to the high frequency and large circulation vortices pairing up into vortex-couples as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:deflected_wake} for $\text{St}=0.6$. Fig.~\ref{fig:deflected_wake_2}(b) shows a \emph{Poincar\'e map} for the lift and drag coefficient of the heaving airfoil at $\text{St}=0.6$, with the asymmetry in the lift resulting in a net mean lift coefficient around $C_L=-1$ for the very large domain with reflection BCs. The new Biot-Savart boundary conditions also predict wake deflection for $\text{St}\ge 0.5$, but truncating this sensitive vortex wake causes the space between the vortex couples to reduce, Fig.~\ref{fig:deflected_wake}(c,d). Using a domain extending only four cord lengths between the foil results in a 10-40\% over-prediction of the measured forces, while doubling the domain recovers the correct spacing and forces to within 5\%.

We expect that in any case where wake history effects are highly dominant, the new Biot-Savart boundary condition will require a domain large enough for this wake to develop ``stable'' dynamics before exiting the domain. However, we should note that the case of 2D deflected thrust wakes is somewhat pathological, depending on long-range vortex interactions only possible in 2D flows. Indeed, experiments on finite foils have shown that these high-lift deflected jets cannot form for finite wings, see \cite{Calderon2014OnWings, Godoy-Diana2008TransitionFoil}.
 
\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we present a novel coupling between potential far-field boundary conditions and viscous incompressible flow simulations. The method relies on a Biot-Savart integral of the vorticity inside the domain to set the velocity boundary conditions on the domain boundaries. We couple these boundary conditions with an explicit projection scheme to solve the momentum and continuity equations in their primitive variable form. Critically, we demonstrate that when using the Biot-Savart equation to the domain boundaries, a coupling between every point on immersed solid boundaries and the domain boundary is introduced. This coupling results in a dense pressure equation that we solve using a partitioned approach, iterating the projection and Biot-Savart update steps, allowing a standard Poisson solver to be used. This approach also makes the solution extremely robust, enabling simple and high-speed FMM variants to be used without sacrificing solution accuracy. In this work we use a multi-level clustering method for the $N$ Eulerian-grid vortex sources, and use this to develop a simple Fast Multi-level Method for the velocity reconstruction with $O(N)$ cost and that can be run in parallel on CPU and GPU architectures. We show that the error introduced by this multilevel approach is bounded and that its influence on the resulting flow field is minimal because of the iterative partitioned approach used for the pressure.

With different examples of flow with confined vorticity, we show that the novel boundary conditions allow for a significant reduction in the size of the computational domain without any loss in accuracy. The method exactly captures added-mass force on an accelerated disk with a computational domain only extending $1/2$ diameter away from the plate. 

Surprisingly, for vortex street applications, the method demonstrates its robustness and perfectly captures the drag forces and vortex shedding frequencies generated by a 2D circular cylinder at $\text{Re}=200$, even with minimal domain sizes ($5D\times3D$). Classical reflection boundary conditions require a domain 48 times bigger to generate time-varying forces indistinguishable from that of the domain with our Biot-Savart boundary conditions. Lastly, we show that the method is limited when a strong wake history influences the flow in the near wake. For a high-amplitude, high-Strouhal number ($St\ge0.5$) heaving airfoil, we show that capturing the deflected wake of the flow requires a significantly larger domain, implying that the computational advantage of the new boundary condition is reduced.

The generality and accuracy of the new approach, even when simulating flows with vortex wakes that are truncated by the domain boundaries, opens a huge range of potential applications. In addition to the welcomed speed-up enabled by using frankly tiny computational domains, the continued accuracy of the simulations challenges the notion of the importance of far-field wake dynamics on the near-body flow, providing compelling evidence to the contrary.

\section{Multilevel error analysis}\label{A0}

\subsection{Analytic error bound}

We derive the error induced by this multilevel approach, starting with the 2D-case and extending the result to 3D. The velocity at location $\vec x$ induced by the circulation from a single cell on level $i+1$ is given by (see Fig.~\ref{Fig_2})
\begin{equation}\label{eq:induced_1}
    \vec{u}^{(i+1)}(\vec{x}) = \frac{\vec{r}}{2\pi|\vec{r}|^2}\times\vec{e}_z\mathcal{P}^{(i)\to(i+1)}\Gamma^{(i)}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{r}=\vec{y}-\vec{x}$, $y$ is the center of the cell, and $\vec{e}_z$ is the out-of-plane unit vector. The velocity induced by the four corresponding cells on level $i$ is
\begin{equation}
    \vec{u}^{(i)}(\vec{x}) = \mathcal{P}^{(i)\to(i+1)}
    % \sum_{j\in\mathcal{D}^{(i)}}
    \left(\frac{\vec{r}_j}{2\pi|\vec{r}_j|^2}\times\vec{e}_z\Gamma^{(i)}_j\right),
\end{equation}
where $\vec{r}_j=\vec{y}_j-\vec{x}$ and $y_j$ are the four cell centers. We can further decompose this expression by noting that $\vec{r}_j=\vec{y}-\vec{x}-\vec{\delta r}_j=\vec{r}-\vec{\delta r}_j$.
%, where $\vec{y}$ is the position of the geometric center of the 4 point vortices. 
% Substitution in Eq.~\theequation~ gives
% \begin{equation}
    % \vec{u}^{(i)}(\vec{x}) = \sum_{i\in\mathcal{D}^{(i)}}\frac{\vec{r}-\vec{\delta r}_i}{2\pi|\vec{r}-\vec{\delta r}_i|^2}\times\vec{e}_z\Gamma^{(i)}_i.
% \end{equation}
For sufficiently large $\vec{r}$ we can assume that $|\vec{r}|\approx|\vec{r}-\vec{\delta r}_j|$ %and thus we have
% \begin{equation}
%     \vec{u}^{(i)}(\vec{x}) = \sum_{i\in\mathcal{D}^{(i)}}\frac{\vec{r}-\vec{\delta r}_i}{2\pi|\vec{r}|^2}\times\vec{e}_z\Gamma_i.
% \end{equation}
which allows us to separate the kernel's influence into two parts
% \begin{equation}
%     \vec{u}^{(i)}(\vec{x}) = \sum_{j\in\mathcal{D}^{(i)}}\frac{\vec{r}}{2\pi|\vec{r}|^2}\times\vec{e}_z\Gamma^{(i)}_j-\sum_{j\in\mathcal{D}^{(i)}}\frac{\vec{\delta r}_j}{2\pi|\vec{r}|^2}\times\vec{e}_z\Gamma^{(i)}_j.
% \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \vec{u}^{(i)}(\vec{x}) = \mathcal{P}^{(i)\to(i+1)}    \left(\frac{\vec{r}}{2\pi|\vec{r}|^2}\times\vec{e}_z\Gamma^{(i)}_j-\frac{\vec{\delta r}_j}{2\pi|\vec{r}|^2}\times\vec{e}_z\Gamma^{(i)}_j\right).
\end{equation}
After rearrangement, the first term equals Eq.~\eqref{eq:induced_1}. The second term is the error due to the multilevel approximation. Its magnitude is
% \begin{equation}
%     \varepsilon(\vec{x})^{(i)} = \sum_{j\in\mathcal{D}^{(i)}}\frac{\vert\vec{\delta r}_j\vert}{2\pi|\vec{r}|^2}\Gamma^{(i)}_j,
% \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \varepsilon(\vec{x})^{(i)} = \mathcal{P}^{(i)\to(i+1)}\frac{\vert\vec{\delta r}_j\vert}{2\pi|\vec{r}|^2}\Gamma^{(i)}_j,
\end{equation}
as $\vec{e}_z$ is a unit vector. On uniform Cartesian meshes, $\vert\vec{\delta r}_j^{(i)}\vert\sim2^{l}$, while $|\vec{r}|^2 \sim (2^l\tilde{S})^2$. An upper bound for the total error in the induced velocity at a point $\vec x$ due to the multilevel evaluation of the Biot-Savart integral is therefore
\begin{equation}
    \varepsilon(\vec{x}) \approx \frac{1}{2\pi\tilde{S}^2}\sum_{i=2}^{l}\frac{1}{2^i}\mathcal{P}^{(i)\to(i+1)}
    % \sum_{i\in\mathcal{D}^{(i)}}
    \Gamma^{(i)}.
\end{equation}
which decays as $\tilde{S}^{-2}$. The content of each sum is a decreasing fraction of the total vorticity contained in the domain $\mathcal{D}^{(i)}$. As expected, taking $\tilde{S}>\text{Domain}$ yields $\varepsilon(\vec{x}) = 0$, and as $\Gamma^{(i)} \to 0, \varepsilon(\vec{x})\to 0$, finally as $\tilde{S}\to0, \varepsilon(\vec{x}) \to \infty$. Similarly, in 3D the upper bound for the error is given by
\begin{equation}
    \varepsilon(\vec{x}) \approx \frac{1}{4\pi\tilde{S}^3}\sum_{i=2}^{l}\frac{1}{2^{2i}}\mathcal{P}^{(i)\to(i+1)}
    % \sum_{j\in\mathcal{D}^{(i)}}
    \Gamma^{(i)}.
\end{equation}
which decays as $\tilde{S}^{-3}$. Similarly, the content of the sum is a (even smaller) decreasing fraction of total vorticity contained in each level, improving the method's accuracy in 3D compared to 2D.

%In our version of the fast multipole method, an additional error is induced by grouping sources at the center of parent cells; targets are also clustered and evaluated on level $i$. To reduce this error, we use (bi)linear interpolation from the neighboring parent (coarser) cells to compute the induced vorticity at a cell face.

% The cost of the evaluation of the Biot-Savart integral is also proportional to the bounding box dimension. Each level contains approximately $\tilde{S}^d$ points, with $d$ the dimension of the problem. Using a $l$-level mutligrid will result in roughly $\tilde{S}^d\times l$ operations. The maximum number of levels is given by $l=N/\tilde{S}$. The total cost is thus $\tilde{S}^{d-1}N$ which is much lower than the total number of operations required to evaluate Eq.~\eqref{eq:Biot} without a multilevel approach.


% Let $\vec{S}^{l}$ be the distance criterion on level $l$, the total error is a sum of all the errors in the $N_l$ lower level of the multilevel
% \begin{equation}
%     \varepsilon^{(1)}(\vec{x}) = \sum_{l=2}^{N_l}\frac{\sqrt{2}\Delta x^{(l-1)}}{4\pi|\vec{S}^{(l-1)}|^2}\sum_{i=1}^{4l}\Gamma_i.
% \end{equation}

% As expected, taking $\vec{S}>\text{Domain}$ yiels $\varepsilon^{(1)}(\vec{x}) = 0$, and as $\Gamma_i \to 0, \varepsilon^{(1)}(\vec{x})\to 0$, finally as $|\vec{S}|\to0, \varepsilon^{(1)}(\vec{x}) \to \infty$. Similarly, in 3D the error is given by
% \begin{equation}
%     \varepsilon^{(1)}(\vec{x}) = \sum_{l=2}^{N_l}\frac{\sqrt{3}\Delta x^{(l-1)}}{16\pi|\vec{S}^{(l-1)}|^3}\sum_{i=1}^{8l}\Gamma_i,
% \end{equation}
% which decays much faster than in 2D.

% The integral in Eq.~\ref{eq:Biot} is then evaluated by the recursive expression, starting from the lowest level of the multilevel
% \begin{equation}
%     f^{(i)}(\vec{x},\vec{y},\vec{\omega}^{(l)}) = \begin{cases}
%         \sum_{\vec{y}\in\mathcal{D}^{(l)}}K^{(l)}(\vec{x},\vec{y},\vec{\omega}^{(l)}), \quad \forall \,\, \vec{y} \in \mathcal{D}^{(l)}\\
%         f^{(l-1)}(\vec{x},\vec{y},\vec{\omega}^{(l-1)}), \,\,\qquad \text{else},
%     \end{cases}
% \end{equation}
% where $K^{(l)}(\vec{x},\vec{y},\vec{\omega}^{(l)})$ is the discrete Biot-Savart kernel at level $l$ and the criterion $\vec{y} \in \mathcal{D}^{(l)}$ is evaluated using a standard cut-of radius.
% \begin{equation}
%     \begin{cases}|\vec{y}-\vec{x}|/2^l<|\vec{S}|, \qquad \vec{y} \in \mathcal{D}^{(l)},\\
%     |\vec{y}-\vec{x}|/2^l>|\vec{S}|, \qquad \vec{y} \notin \mathcal{D}^{(l)}.
%     \end{cases} 
% \end{equation}

% \textbf{Must be a bounding box and not a cut-off radius}
% \textbf{Still need to show the cost to evaluate integral is logN. $S^2*l$}

\subsection{2D vortex reconstruction example}

We next use an analytic 2D vortex field to demonstrate the error in the reconstruction method. The velocity field generated by the Lamb-Chaplygin dipole is defined by the scalar stream function
\begin{equation}
    \psi(r) = \begin{cases}
    \frac{-2UJ_1(\beta r)}{\beta J_0(\beta R)}, \quad \text{for} \quad r < R,\\
    U\left(\frac{R^2}{r}-r\right), \quad \text{for} \quad r \ge R,    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $J_0$ and $J_1$ are the zeroth and first Bessel functions of the first kind, respectively, and $\beta$ is a parameter with the value $\beta=1.2197\pi/R$. The 2D velocity field is given by $\vec{u} = -\vec{e}_z\times \nabla \psi$, and the core of the vortex is defined by the isoline $\psi(r=R)=0$.

% \label{fig:lam_error_dist}
% \end{figure}

We reconstruct the velocity field outside the vortex core using the internal vorticity and our multilevel Biot-Savart method and compare that to the analytic result. We reconstruct the velocity on a domain of size $[2^8,2^8]$. The dependency of the absolute error in the reconstructed velocity field on the half-width $\tilde S$ of the subdomains are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:error_lamb_2}(a). Setting $\tilde S$ to the domain size $\cal D$ eliminates the source clustering error, but the result is not exact since the analytic vorticity distribution is sampled on a finite grid of size $\Delta x=0.05
R$. This error depends primarily on the distance from the vortex, Fig.~\ref{fig:error_lamb_2}(a). Progressively reducing the subdomain size introduces the multilevel error quantified in appendix A, which is only weakly dependent on the distance to the vortex. Fig.~\ref{fig:error_lamb_2}(b) reports the measured computational speed-up achieved by the multilevel method relative to setting $\tilde S=\Omega$, demonstrating up to 300$\times$ acceleration.

\subsection{3D vortex reconstruction example}

This validation is repeated in 3D using the classical \emph{Hill vortex}, whose radial and tangential velocity components are given by
\begin{align}
    v_r &= \frac{1}{r^2\sin\theta}\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial\theta}, \qquad v_\theta = -\frac{1}{r\sin\theta}\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial r}.
\end{align}
and the stream function 
\begin{equation}
    \psi(r,\theta) = \begin{cases}
    -\frac{3U}{4}\left(1-\frac{r^2}{R^2}\right)r^2sin^2\theta \quad \text{for} \, r \le R,\\
     \,\,\frac{U}{2}\left(1-\frac{r^3}{R^3}\right)r^2sin^2\theta \quad \text{for} \, r > R.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
with the corresponding errors and speed-up shown in Figure~\ref{fig:error_hill_3}. Note that the analytic vorticity of the hill vortex is discontinuous, increasing the truncation error near the vortex compared to the smooth 2D Lamb-dipole.

The multilevel error decreases extremely quickly as $\tilde S$ is increased for three-dimensional flows. This is due to the scaling of the Biot-Savart kernel itself. Similarly, the speed-up is much faster in 3D because each doubling gathers 8 cells instead of 4, with a max observed speed-up of nearly 20,000$\times$ using the multilevel method.

\section{Accounting for symmetries in the Biot-Savart integral}
\label{A1}

Symmetries can be accounted for in the multilevel evaluation of the Biot-Savart integral Eq.~\ref{eq:Biot}. We focus on a description of the 2D case; the extension to the 3D is trivial. For a flow with symmetries, like the 2D flow around a flat plate, see Figure~\ref{a1:fig_1}, whose axis of symmetries is represented by the dash-dotted line, the computational domain $\Omega$ only models the upper part of the plate. The domain $\Omega^\dagger$ is the image of the computational domain $\Omega$ about the symmetry axis.

Evaluation of the induced velocity at a point on the boundary of the computational domain $\vec{x}\in\partial\Omega$ (apart from points on the symmetry plane which have the reflection condition applied to them) on the $i$th-level is given by
\begin{equation}\label{a1;eq}
     {\vec u}({\vec x}) = \int_{\mathcal{R}^{(i)}} K_{n}({\vec x} - \vec{y})\times \hat{e}_z\omega({\vec y})\text{ d}\vec{y} + \int_{{\mathcal{R}^{(i)}}^\dagger} K_{n}({\vec x} - \vec{y}^\dagger)\times \hat{e}_z\omega^\dagger({\vec y}^\dagger)\text{ d}\vec{y}^\dagger
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{R}^{(i)}\equiv\mathcal{D}^{(i)}\cap\Omega$ and ${\mathcal{R}^{(i)}}^\dagger\equiv\mathcal{D}^{(i)}\cap\Omega^\dagger$. Additionally, $\overline{\mathcal{R}^{(i)}}^\dagger\subset\mathcal{R}^{(i)}$ is the images of ${\mathcal{R}^{(i)}}^\dagger$ in $\Omega$ and ${\vec{y}}^\dagger$ is the images of $\vec{y}$ in $\Omega^\dagger$, respectively.

Points inside ${\mathcal{R}^{(i)}}$ (blue region) are evaluated on the computational domain $\Omega$. For points in ${\mathcal{R}^{(i)}}^\dagger$ (orange region), the image vorticity is computed by applying the symmetric condition to the vorticity in $\overline{\mathcal{R}^{(i)}}^\dagger$ (pink region)
\begin{equation}
    \omega^\dagger(\vec{y}^\dagger) = -\omega(\vec{y}), \quad\quad \vec{y}\in\overline{\mathcal{R}^{(i)}}^\dagger,
\end{equation}
for 2D flows; for 3D flows, computing the image vorticity vector requires computing its reflection about the symmetry plane. Substituting in Eq.~\ref{a1;eq} yields an integral only over the region $\mathcal{R}^{(i)}$
\begin{equation}
     {\vec u}({\vec x}) = \int_{\mathcal{R}^{(i)}} \left(K_{n}({\vec x} - \vec{y})-K_{n}({\vec x} - \vec{y}^\dagger)\right)\times \hat{e}_z\omega({\vec y})\text{ d}\vec{y},
\end{equation}
where the second term in the parenthesis only appears if $\mathcal{D}^{(i)}$ overlaps with the domain's image $\Omega^\dagger$. A similar expression is found for 3D flows. As Eq.~\theequation~ solely relies on the vorticity in the computational domain $\Omega$, no additional computations are required, and accounting for the image's induced velocity simply requires accounting for its influence through the kernel $K_n$.
